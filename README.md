# zombie_dice_simulation
This code simulates a game of Zombie Dice the specified number of times. 
It also provides the results of all of the games.

I wrote this for fun as a MadR hack night project. It works but doesn't
follow the rules of Zombie Dice (see notes in file). Maybe someone wants
to finish it?
